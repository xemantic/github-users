# About github-users

Lists GitHub users. Minimal app demonstrating cross-platform app development
(Web, Android, iOS) where core logic is shared and
[transpiled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler)
from Java to JavaScript and Objective-C.

# Demo

Please rather take a look at frontend flavors:

* [github-users-web](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-web)
* [github-users-android](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-android)
* [github-users-ios](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-ios)

# Why I started such a project?

Google claims that applications like [Google Inbox](https://www.google.com/inbox/)
can [share up to 70% of client code between all the platforms](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2014/11/going-under-hood-of-inbox.html).
It's significant achievement when taking into account:

* reduced Total Cost of Ownership with only one code base to maintain
* naturally synchronized development process across all the teams
(backend, presentation logic, frontend, mobile)
* the same features release for all the platforms
* and the time-to-market for new value is shorter

Just to name a few. Usually cross-platform development tools fall into these categories:

* abstraction over native UI components and IO operations (specialized API
accessible from any possible programming language which is later either interpreted
or compiled for specific platform)
* HTML+CSS forced as UI on mobile 

But there is a third way, where only presentation logic code is shared and UI rendering
and IO stays native. Where iOS, Web and Android developers can customize the app in every
detail.

This approach seems to be the most demanding one in terms of software architecture. Common business
logic cannot operate on technical terms. Mouse click or touch event are becoming
stream of semantically defined user intents. HTTP request to remote services are becoming
streams of domain data. But I believe it is worth it. Abstracting app logic from specific
platform brings much better overall architecture which pays off in the future when
the application grows.

As there is no blueprint from Google on how to build applications like Google Inbox, I decided
to use my whole experience to "reverse engineer" possible approach and provide such a minimal project.
I hope to push it even further in terms of reactive
programming on top of RxJava as it is quite popular on Android, there is GWT port, and apparently
it is possible to transpile the whole library to Objective-C.

It does not matter so much what this application is doing and if it is useful at all.
I did not want to provide any backend component and struggle with deployment. Therefore I decided
to display data loaded from one of public APIs available on the Internet and
[GitHub users search API](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users)
will serve as a good example.

# Use case

As application user I want to submit query to search for GitHub users 
so that relevant user list will be displayed.

# Architecture

This project provides conceptual presentation logic without actual UI code bound to any platform.

For the platform specific code see:

* [github-users-web](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-web)
* [github-users-android](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-android)
* [github-users-ios](https://github.com/xemantic/github-users-ios)

Technically it is a library containing Java code which will be transpiled either
to JavaScript ([GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/)) or to
Objective-C ([J2ObjC](https://developers.google.com/j2objc/))
code for Web and iOS platform respectively. In case of
Android platform the Java code can be used directly.

## Dependencies

Only minimal set of Java 8 classes is used plus:

* [javax-inject](http://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/) - JSR-330 Dependency Injection
* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) - Reactive Extensions for the JVM
* [junit](http://junit.org/junit4/) - JUnit is a simple framework to write repeatable tests
* [mockito](http://site.mockito.org/) - Tasty mocking framework for unit tests in Java
* [hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/) - Matchers that can be combined to create flexible expressions of intent 

These popular dependencies will either have emulation on all the platforms or
be transpiled to the native code.

## Model-View-Presenter

Basically view is dumb and can be mocked while presenter has testable logic.

See [Model-View-Presenter article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)
article on Wikipedia.

## Reactive paradigm

RxJava is a crucial component of this solution and supports:
 
* general EventBus which decouples presenters and therefore visual components
* handling of asynchronous responses from remote web services
* abstracting the way how UI events are streamed to the presenter logic

## EventBus and events

The singleton [EventBus](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/eventbus/EventBus.java)
allows indirect communication of the presenters
resolving traditional issue of direct coupling and component nesting in the UI code.

    UserQueryPresenter -- UserQueryEvent -----> +----------+
    UserListPresenter <-- UserQueryEvent ------ | EventBus |
    UserPresenter ------- UserSelectedEvent --> +----------+

Any other component might subscribe to EventBus in the frontend implementation
to receive `UserSelectedEvent` and redirect view to GitHub profile in platform-specific way.

Here is an example usage of the `EventBus`:

```java
eventBus.observe(StatusUpdateEvent.class) // returns Observable
    .subscribeOn(renderingScheuler)
    .subscribe(event -> view.displayStatus(event.getStatus()));
```
```java
eventBus.post(new StatusUpdateEvent("OK"));
```

Note: the `EventBus` and `EventTracker` utility from this projects will
be extracted to separate library in the future.

Only 3 special event types were defined for this app:
* [Trigger](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/event/Trigger.java) - used internally for payload-less signals coming from `Observables` 
* [UserQueryEvent](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/event/UserQueryEvent.java)
* [UserSelectedEvent](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/event/UserSelectedEvent.java)

## Service Access Layer

### Service

Is provided exclusively by interfaces [UserSearchService](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/service/UserService.java)
which returns `Observable` (technically `Single`) of [SearchResult](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/model/SearchResult.java)
holding also the list of [User](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/model/User.java)s.

Services can be implemented using:

* [Retrofit + RxJava](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) on Android
* [AutoREST for GWT](https://github.com/intendia-oss/autorest)

### Model

The structure of `SearchResult` interface reflects
[JSON structure of GitHub API response](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users).

When implementing these entities various methods might be used like

* GSON/jackson json parser for android
* `@JsInterop` annotations for GWT

## View

Only interfaces to be implemented here
* [UserQueryView](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/view/UserQueryView.java) - represents textual input where the query is provided
* [UserListView](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/view/UserListView.java)
* [UserView](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/view/UserView.java) - single element in the list.

## Presenter

The only part of the code which is not provided as interfaces.
Each view is accompanied with respective presenter.

* [UserQueryPresenter](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/presenter/UserQueryPresenter.java)
* [UserListPresenter](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/presenter/UserListPresenter.java)
(the most complex one)
* [UserViewPresenter](src/main/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/presenter/UserPresenter.java)

Expectations for these presenters are visible in their
[test cases](src/test/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/presenter)
which account for most code in this project.

## Testing

By following MVP principles all the views are prepared in the way they can be mocked and
assumptions can be made against their state in the unit tests. Ready presenters are
coming with full test coverage and test cases can be transpiled as well to be run again on
the target platform. See example
[UserPresenterTest](src/test/java/com/xemantic/githubusers/presenter/UserPresenterTest.java).

# User Experience design

The [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) will be used on all the platforms
with help of [Material Components](https://material.io/components/).
